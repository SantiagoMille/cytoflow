Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

These are some questions that are commonly asked about Cytoflow's GUI,
especially by new users.

**I've made one of the panels (eg, the View settings panel) disappear. How do I make it come back?**

You can restore them by going to the ``View`` menu and toggling the checkbox next to the panel 
that you made disappear.

**I have some information in the FCS files' metadata that I'd like to use as experimental variables. How do I "import" them?**

In the **Experiment Setup** dialog:

  #. Click **Add a variable**
  
  #. Select **FCS Metadata** as the variable type
  
  #. Choose the metadata you want from the **Name** dropdown
  
  #. *Change* the **Type** to something appropriate -- probably **Number** or **Category**
