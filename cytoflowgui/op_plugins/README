This is where the "ui adapter" bits go for the various operations.  Each op
gets
 - a class derived from OpHandler, which contains the view and associated controller
   logic
 - a class derived from envisage.Plugin:
   a Envisage service plugin wrapping the op

This is also where Sphinx goes to look for the user manual documentation
for each operatino. The actual "operation" classes are in workflow.operations.
